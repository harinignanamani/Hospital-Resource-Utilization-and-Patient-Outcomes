## Project Title
Hospital Resource Utilization and Patient Outcomes Dashboard

## Problem Statement
Hospitals handle a large number of patients across multiple departments every day.  
Without proper analytics, it becomes difficult to monitor resource usage, identify peak load times, track patient outcomes, and plan doctors and beds efficiently.

This dashboard addresses these challenges by transforming hospital data into clear KPIs and interactive visualizations to support better operational decision-making.

## Dataset Description
A synthetic hospital dataset was created based on the given problem requirements, as no dataset was provided for this hackathon.

The dataset includes:
- Patient demographics (age, gender, insurance type)
- Admission and discharge details
- Department information
- Doctor schedules and utilization
- Emergency vs scheduled cases
- Patient outcomes

## KPIs and Metrics
The following key performance indicators were calculated and visualized:
- Total Patients Admitted
- Average Length of Stay (Days)
- Emergency Case Load (%)
- Readmission Rate (%)
- Doctor Utilization (%)
- Patient Outcome Distribution

These KPIs provide a high-level view of hospital efficiency and operational performance.

## Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard allows users to:
- Analyze patient distribution across departments
- Compare emergency and scheduled cases
- Monitor doctor utilization by department
- Track patient outcomes and discharge trends
- Filter insights using department-level slicers

The dashboard is designed for non-technical hospital administrators to easily interpret and use.

## Key Insights
- Emergency cases account for a significant portion of total admissions.
- Doctor utilization is balanced across most departments.
- Orthopedics shows the highest patient volume.
- The majority of patients are either recovered or improved.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Dataset creation)
- Power BI (Dax and dashboard)

## Conclusion
This dashboard provides a clear view of hospital operations by tracking patient flow, 
doctor utilization, emergency cases, and outcomes. It helps hospital administrators 
quickly identify workload imbalance and operational bottlenecks. The use of simple 
KPIs and visuals makes the dashboard easy to understand for non-technical users. 
Overall, the solution supports better decision-making for efficient resource utilization 
and patient care.
